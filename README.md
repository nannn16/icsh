# Milestone 7: Extra features
I add three more features. <br />
`cd <dir name>` change current directory to the given directory path. <br />
`cd` without given directory path will change current directory to home directory. <br />
`fg` without %<job_id> brings the current job into the foreground <br />
`bg` without %<job_id> execute the suspended job that is the current job in the background. <br />
Otherwise, if there is no current job, it will print "no current job".
